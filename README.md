The steps for how I approached each section is outlined closely within the comments if you check the source code.

In theory, this would work almost completely if I had the correct payload, but I did not finish creating the payload for
meterpreter in Kali. This is the first section of the code, where the dropbox link would link to a dropbox file that
had the meterpreter exe file, download it immediately, and run it so that we can have a backdoor into the system. However,
I did put the code that I would have run in order to make the meterpreter in Kali in the comments.

Furthermore, I did not completely figure out how to download and install GPG. I figured out how to download the GPG installer 
and run it, but I couldn't figure out a way to automatically install it without having to manually click yes, accept, etc.

I also did not put any add-on on the default browser because honestly I didn't know what add-on to put on and it's the same
problem above where you have to automatically install the add-on without pressing manually yes or no. 

My rubber ducky was supposed to come on Wednesday (Yeah, I'm sorry I procrastinated with that but what are you going to do now),
but then I accidentally put the wrong billing information (put my Dad's name instead of mine because of autocomplete on the address) 
and they withheld my order and sent me an email (that I didn't read because of being home at Thanksgiving), so the rubber ducky is coming
on Wednesday instead (oops). Therefore, I didn't make the video, so the code is theoretical but I am pretty confident that it would 
work if I ran it (you can review it, and the process that I went through during the comments and it is pretty logical).

I think that this is some solid source code though, have some mercy on me please when you are grading this.

Sincerely,
Patrick Truong
